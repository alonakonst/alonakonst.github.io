### Brazil Votes: The 2022 Presidential Runoff
A visual analysis of the race between Lula and Bolsonaro.


## Introduction
In the 2022 presidential runoff, Brazil divided along regional, economic, and social lines. This analysis explores how the country voted and what the data tells us about this polarization

#### Socioeconomic Correlation

In the visualization below, we explore the relationship between the Human Development Index (HDI) of Brazilian municipalities and their voting direction across three presidential elections: 2014, 2018, and 2022. Each panel represents one election year, comparing the distribution of HDI scores between municipalities that predominantly voted for left-leaning or right-leaning candidates.

What stands out immediately is the consistent pattern across all three elections: municipalities that voted for right-wing candidates tend to have higher HDI values, while those supporting the left cluster around lower HDI levels. This is reflected in the positioning of the red and blue curves. The red curve (representing left-leaning municipalities) peaks around the 0.58–0.62 HDI range, whereas the blue curve (right-leaning) consistently peaks above 0.70. The limited overlap between the two distributions reinforces the idea that HDI is a meaningful factor associated with political orientation at the local level.

Notably, this trend remains remarkably stable over time. Despite changes in political climate, national leadership, and campaign dynamics, the socioeconomic divide in voting behavior appears entrenched. There may even be a slight sharpening of this divide in 2022, with the distributions becoming more distinct, suggesting an increasing alignment between development indicators and electoral outcomes.

Overall, the plot offers compelling evidence of how development levels correlate with political preferences in Brazil. It points to a structural pattern in which municipalities with higher levels of education, income, and life expectancy (all components of HDI) are more likely to support right-wing candidates, while those with lower HDI scores show greater support for the left. This finding not only contributes to understanding the 2014–2022 elections but also highlights the broader social and economic dimensions of voting behavior in the country.

#### Conclusion:
The 2022 election reflects deep historical and socioeconomic divides across Brazil. Our analysis shows how geography, city size, and economic factors critically influenced the final outcome."
