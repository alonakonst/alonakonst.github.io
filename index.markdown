A visual analysis of the race between left and right ideologies.


## **Introduction**
Between 2014 and 2022, Brazil experienced dramatic political shifts. Our story is about how geography, development, and demographics shaped the race between left- and right-wing ideologies during presidential elections. In addition the last presidential election was characterized by a high level of polarization in which the difference between the 2 candidates(Lula and Bolsonaro) in the second round was won by Lula by just a difference of 2,1 million votes with 50.9% against 49.1%.

Using official voting data and socioeconomic indicators, we uncover patterns in city-level results across time and space.

## **Who Won in Each City and State?**
The interactive map below shows Brazilian municipalities colored by the vote direction (left vs. right) in each election year. Use the selector to switch between 2014, 2018, and 2022.

## **Which City Sizes Influenced Brazilâ€™s Elections the Most?**

<p>Is it the megacities with millions of people that shape election outcomes the most, or is it the sheer number of small cities that carry the real influence?</p>

<p>The dashboard below (feel free to switch between 2018 and 2022 results) reveal that the majority of Brazilian cities fall into the <em>Small and Medium Town</em> categories, with between 2.5K and 100000K voters.</p>

<!-- Script to map year to custom image name -->
<script>
  function switchImage(year) {
    var img = document.getElementById("city-image");
    var imageMap = {
      "2018": "{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2018.png",
      "2022": "{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2022.png"
    };
    img.src = imageMap[year];
  }
</script>

<p>In <strong>2018</strong>, this category experienced an average decline of about <strong>0.4 percentage points (or 4%)</strong> in support for right-wing candidates compared to 2014. However, due to the large number of such towns, they collectively accounted for nearly a <strong>quarter (22%) of the total ideological shift</strong>. Other major contributors were <em>Medium</em> and <em>Large Towns</em>. Altogether, about <strong>70% of the ideological shift</strong> came from cities with fewer than <strong>500K voters</strong> â€” a shift that ultimately contributed to the right coming to power.</p>

<p>Now letâ€™s look at <strong>2022</strong>: Who contributed the most to the right losing power?</p>

<p>According to our analysis, it was voters in <em>Medium-Sized Towns</em>. That said, towns overall played a smaller role in the shift â€” their average positions remained more stable. Instead, we observe that <strong>cities with over 250K voters increased their influence</strong>, signaling a shift in political momentum toward Brazilâ€™s urban centers.</p>

## **Voting from Abroad**
Many Brazilian citizens cast their votes from abroad. This map shows which side won in each foreign city with a Brazilian polling station. 

Over time, a clear shift is visible: while right-leaning support was more prominent in 2014, many citiesâ€”especially across Latin America, Africa, and Europeâ€”moved toward the left in 2018 and 2022. The plot highlights not only regional political shifts but also reflects how diaspora communities around the world align with evolving domestic trends in Brazil.

## **Is there any correlation between HDI(Human Development Index) of a city and the ideology that the majority of the population vote?**
This plot reveals a strong correlation between HDI and political preference. Right-leaning municipalities consistently exhibit higher HDI scores, while left-leaning areas cluster around lower values.

  style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />

Municipalities that supported right-wing candidates tend to have better indicators in income, education, and longevity (the HDI components). This trend persistedâ€”and even sharpenedâ€”across all three elections. The socioeconomic divide has not only endured but grown more distinct over time.

## **The social minority tends to vote more left?**


The following plots shows a clear trend: municipalities with a low percentage of Black and Indigenous population tend to vote right, while those with higher minority representation lean more toward the left. Most cities have minority proportions below 20%, and in these areas, right-leaning candidates dominate the vote share.

  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/average_minority_population.png" 
  alt="Global vote direction map"
  style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" />
  
As the minority proportion increases, support for left-leaning candidates becomes more common, especially beyond the 30â€“40% range. This suggests a strong correlation between racial composition and political preference.

Overall, the data highlights how race and electoral outcomes are closely linked in Brazil, with minority-rich cities more aligned with left-wing candidates.

## **States with the need of more Welfare Social Program tends to vote more left? And what about States that use less?**

States in Brazil with a higher proportion of households participating in social assistance programsâ€”as reflected in the number of families per 1,000 inhabitantsâ€”tend to be concentrated in regions that have historically shown greater support for left-leaning political parties. This correlation suggests that social policies and redistributive programs may resonate more strongly with populations in economically vulnerable states, such as PiauÃ­, MaranhÃ£o, and Alagoas. These areas not only have higher rates of participation in programs like Bolsa FamÃ­lia but also consistently report higher left-wing vote shares in national elections. While correlation does not imply causation, this pattern highlights the socio-political alignment between social program beneficiaries and progressive political agendas.


## **Conclusion**


Brazil's recent presidential elections was an interesting event which was represented by the highest polarization between left and right ideology since the democracy started in the country. Through this project was possible to go deep in the vote dataset to understand a bit better how it was distributed and represented. It was possible to see some regionals polarizations, in a way that the Center and South looks more towards the right ideology when voting, while the northeast is much more represented by the left.

Some analysis also was done via granularity by looking how was the behavior for big, medium and small cities. The capitals looked to be more progressists(left), even  that the overall state tends to be more right-ideology. Some deeper analysis regarding historical voting data in cities, which showed that on average mid-sized cities have most changed their vote ideology between the last elections, which could help to explain why at this time(last election) the left party won the most of the votes.

Also was possible to analyse how the minorities and people who emigrated vote, which showed to be more towards left, while cities with higher HDI tends to have the population voting more right.

These data analysis of previous elections helps to understand some behaviors of the brazilian electorate, make some correlations with the polarization that also happens in the whole world and mainly also helps to give some direction on how are the trends for the next election next year, and maybe in which type of public each political party should focus on in order to win the elections.
